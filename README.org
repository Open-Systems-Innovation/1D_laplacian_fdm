#+TITLE:Solution to a 1D Laplacian equation using FDM
This repository proves a 1D solution to the Laplacian equation using PETSc. It also supplies a build in Nix development environment using the ~flake.nix~ file.

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a simple learning example for interfacing with the C bindings in the ~PETSc~ library.
* How to run the simulation
This is a uniprocessor example. In general we could run a ~PETSc~ progam as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mpiexec -n 8 ./petsc_program_name petsc_options
#+END_SRC
Therefore, the simplest way of running the ~main.c~ file in this repository is:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mpiexec -n 1 ./main
#+END_SRC
